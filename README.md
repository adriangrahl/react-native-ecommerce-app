**Yarn package manager:** you can start by installing yarn at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

Run **yarn add global json-server**

Open another console/terminal tab and run **json-server server.json** to serve some products locally as a backend would.

**P.S.**

This project uses **reactotron** when dev env so that we can take a look at what's going on into the app (https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron)
